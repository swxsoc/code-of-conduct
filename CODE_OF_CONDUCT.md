# Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

NASA recognizes and supports the benefits of having diverse and inclusive scientific, engineering, and technology communities and fully expects that such values will be reflected in open source project teams. Discrimination and harassment, including sexual harassment, are not tolerated by NASA. Having a diverse, inclusive, and safe workplace is essential to achieving the excellence for which NASA strives. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines the expectations for ourselves and for those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## 2. Open Source Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

## 3. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all contributors including HERMES team members:

 * Participate in an authentic and active way.
 * Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
 * Attempt collaboration before conflict.
 * Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
 * Alert HERMES team members if you notice violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

## 4. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable:

 * Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
 * Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
 * Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
 * Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
 * Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
 * Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; and unwelcomed sexual advances.
 * Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
 * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
 * Sustained disruption of meetings or on communications platforms.

## 5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from anyone including HERMES team members, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

## 6. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a HERMES team member as soon as possible using the contact info provided below.

Additionally, the NASA Office of Diversity and Equal Opportunity (ODEO) is available for filing complaints especially if the complaint pertains to a HERMES team member. Information on filing a complaint through ODEO may be found at https://missionstem.nasa.gov/filing-a-complaint.html.

## 7. Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify a HERMES team member with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies. 

## 8. Scope

We expect all participants to abide by this Code of Conduct in all public venues--online and in-person--as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to HERMES SOC business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
